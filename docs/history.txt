The project was originally written in SQL, this has got complex to my simple mind.
So, rewriting the project in Pandas - it looks simpler [we shall soon see].

NB : The program is run from the command line and display it's results there.


V2025.9     [26 January 2025]

    Completed the third of the reports - monthly Records.
        This displays a table of the maximum and minimum values for a given month.
        The month can be supplied from the command line or if none given then taken from the config file.

    Created a requirements.txt


V2025.8     [23 January 2025]

    Completed the second of the reports - yearly Records.
        This displays a table of the maximum and minimum values for a given year.
        The year can be supplied from the command line or if none given then taken from the config file.
    Also, added a list of valid years to the config, nay given year is checked against this.

    Corrected a bug in the dataFrame, it needs to be re-sorted by date after each new data add.


V2025.7     [20 January 2025]

    There was problem with the index, which was the date.
    It was held as a string, but needed to be a datetime - for grouping by month and year.
    Converting to datetime proved troublesome being an index - to me anyways.
    So, I made a numerical index and made date a regular column after conversion.
    This throw out the all time report - so, fixed this.


V2025.6     [16 January 2025]

    Added another command line argument --Zap.
        This clears both file and data stores [deletes the pickle files].
        This allows the file and data store to be re-built from scratch.


V2025.5     [16 January 2025]

    Format values correctly and add imperial equivalents to report, if appropriate.
    Formatted the date to a more UK format.


V2025.4     [16 January 2025]

    Completed the first of the reports - All Time Records.
        This displays a table of the maximum and minimum values of all time.


V2025.3     [15 January 2025]

    Completed the work on the data processing system.
    The weather data is held in a excel spreadsheet, each one is loaded into a Pandas dataFrame.
    All the data is held in one dataFrame at the moment.
    When each file is processed is marked as thus in the File Store.


V2025.2     [13 January 2025]

    Completed the work on the data file retrieval system.
    The data files are added to the File Store and then a check is made for files to be processed.


V2025.1     [11 January 2025]

    Basic framework completed.
    Most of the original project deleted.
    The app now scan the data directory for new files and produces a list of those to be processed.
